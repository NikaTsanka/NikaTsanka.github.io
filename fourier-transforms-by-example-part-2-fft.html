            <p>In the part 1 of Fourier Transforms by Example we showed how to compute Discrete Fourier Transform which is fairly easy to do, however there is a better and smarter way of computing Fourier Transforms using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), just a faster algorithm, which is the method used in real world applications. </p>
<p>Again here we aren't going to get into the details on how FFT works, for that here is a really nice explanation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsJGuI7e_ZQ">The Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm</a>, but it's worth noting how much better it performs over DFT. So, DFT is about θ(n^2) and FFT is about θ(n log n), which is a significant improvement. Keep in mind that this is one of the FFT varients. </p>
<p>Now let's consider the same number list as in part one. 36, 22, 45, 15. One thing we have to remember is that the number of elements has to be a power of 2, and why is that we will see shortly.</p>
<p>As you already know DFT is:</p>
<p><img alt="DFT" src="/images/d-fourier-f.jpg"></p>
<p>Now let's re-write this: The basic idea is to break up a transform of length  N into two transforms of length N/2 using the identity.</p>
<h3>Forward FFT</h3>
<p><img alt="FFT" src="/images/fft.png"></p>
<p>First we group the elements according to even and odd positions, until we are down to a single element. Then when we combine the even and odd indexes. If you don't know what we are doing, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsJGuI7e_ZQ">The Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Now we can start the butterfly computation </p>
<p><img alt="FFT-HAND" src="/images/fft-hand.png"></p>
<p>Eplaination:</p>
<p>Steps 1, 2 and 3 are self-explanatory, we are simply regrouping the numbers. Step 4, we take an even and an odd element and start the butterfly computation. At this point we only have 2 elements, thus we have N = 2. We can make things easier if we precomputed weights. Weights are the exponent values that are derived from a unit circle. You can see the pre-computed weights on top. When N = 2, 0th weight will always be 1, so we the same number. Step 5, here N = 4 and when n = 1 we get -i. In the last step we simply divide the results derived in step 5 by N which is 4. And we get the same results as in Part 1 of <a href="https://nikatsanka.github.io/fourier-transforms-by-example-part-1-dft.html">Fourier Transforms by Example</a> but with far less computation.\</p>
<p>And that's it. Cool right? </p>
